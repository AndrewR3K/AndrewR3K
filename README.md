### Hello! I'm is Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack engineer who loves to create new ways to ease the friction of everyday life.

ðŸš€ My current preferred stack is MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue, Node), but I enjoy working on allll sorts of framworks and technologies. I believe that the more you verse youself in other stacks and technologies, you can bring better practices and idiologies to your current preferred stack.
