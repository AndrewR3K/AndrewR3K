### Hello! I'm Andrew 👋

I am a fullstack engineer who loves to create new ways to ease the friction of everyday life.

🚀 My current preferred stack is MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue, Node), but I enjoy working on all sorts of frameworks and technologies. I believe that the more you verse yourself in other stacks and technologies, you can bring better practices and ideologies to your current preferred stack.

As a hobby I enjoy 3d Printing🖨️, Developing scripts for RedM🤠, and camping⛺ whenever possible!

Open Source Software (OSS) is a major passion of mine that has driven me to create a few different OSS Organizations, Appications, and scripts. Some of my favorites include:
- [Bryce Canyon County (BCC)](https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty)
- [Feather Framework](https://github.com/BryceCanyonCounty)
- [Red Lookup](https://redlookup.com/)
- [RedOwl](https://redlookup.com/redowl)
