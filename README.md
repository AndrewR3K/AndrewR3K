### Hello! I'm Andrew 👋

I am a fullstack engineer who loves to create new ways to ease the friction of everyday life.

🚀 My current preferred stack is MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue, Node), but I enjoy working on all sorts of frameworks and technologies. I believe that the more you verse yourself in other stacks and technologies, you can bring better practices and ideologies to your current preferred stack.

As a hobby I enjoy 3d Printing🖨️, Developing scripts for RedM🤠, and camping⛺ whenever possible!
